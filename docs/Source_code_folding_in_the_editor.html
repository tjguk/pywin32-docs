<H1>Source code folding in the editor</H1>

Thanks to Scintilla (http://www.scintilla.org), Pythonwin supports 

source code folding.  Folding is the ability to collapse sections of 

your source-code into a single line, making it easier to navigate 

around large files.  Any Python statement which introduces a new block 

can be folded either by clicking on the indicator in the folding 

margin (if enabled via the View-&gt;Options-&gt;Editor dialog), by 

selecting one of the folding keystrokes (see <A HREF="Keyboard_Bindings.html">Keyboard Bindings</A>, or 

by using View-&gt;Folding menu.)  <BR><P>

All find/replace or 'goto linenumber' functions work correctly when 

code is folded - the code is simply unfolded if necessary before the 

relevant operation.  <BR><P>

You may configure Pythonwin so that all files have their top-levels 

folded when opened.  Only the first level folds are collapsed using 

this function, so expanding the top-level fold reveals the entire 

class/method that was folded.  Alternatively, you can use the 

Keypad-Multiply key to toggle the first level folds for the entire 

file at any time.  <BR><P>
