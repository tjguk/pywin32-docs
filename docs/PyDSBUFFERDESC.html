<H1>PyDSBUFFERDESC Object</H1><P>

A Python object, representing a DSBUFFERDESC structure<P>

<H3>Properties</H3>

<DL>

<DT><B>integer dwFlags</B>

<DD>Identifies the capabilities to include when creating a new DirectSoundBuffer object.

</TR>

<TR><TD></TD><TD></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_PRIMARYBUFFER</TD><TD>Indicates that the buffer is a primary sound buffer. If this value is not specified, 

a secondary sound buffer will be created.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_STATIC</TD><TD>Indicates that the buffer will be used for static sound data. Typically, these buffers are 

loaded once and played many times. These buffers are candidates for hardware memory.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_LOCHARDWARE</TD><TD>The buffer is in hardware memory and uses hardware mixing.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_LOCSOFTWARE</TD><TD>The buffer is in software memory and uses software mixing.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_CTRL3D</TD><TD>The buffer is either a primary buffer or a secondary buffer that uses 3-D control. To create 

a primary buffer, the dwFlags member of the DSBUFFERDESC structure should include the DSBCAPS_PRIMARYBUFFER flag.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_CTRLFREQUENCY</TD><TD>The buffer must have frequency control capability.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_CTRLPAN</TD><TD>The buffer must have pan control capability.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_CTRLVOLUME</TD><TD>The buffer must have volume control capability.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_CTRLPOSITIONNOTIFY</TD><TD>The buffer must have control position notify capability.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_STICKYFOCUS</TD><TD>Changes the focus behavior of the sound buffer. This flag can be specified in an 

IDirectSound::CreateSoundBuffer call. With this flag set, an application using DirectSound can continue to play 

its sticky focus buffers if the user switches to another application not using DirectSound. In this situation, 

the application's normal buffers are muted, but the sticky focus buffers are still audible. This is useful for 

nongame applications, such as movie playback (DirectShow&#153;), when the user wants to hear the soundtrack while 

typing in Microsoft Word or Microsoft&#174; Excel, for example. However, if the user switches to another DirectSound 

application, all sound buffers, both normal and sticky focus, in the previous application are muted.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_GLOBALFOCUS</TD><TD>The buffer is a global sound buffer. With this flag set, an application using 

DirectSound can continue to play its buffers if the user switches focus to another application, even if the new 

application uses DirectSound. The one exception is if you switch focus to a DirectSound application that uses the 

DSSCL_EXCLUSIVE or DSSCL_WRITEPRIMARY flag for its cooperative level. In this case, the global sounds from other 

applications will not be audible.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_GETCURRENTPOSITION2</TD><TD>Indicates that IDirectSoundBuffer::GetCurrentPosition should use the new 

behavior of the play cursor. In DirectSound in DirectX 1, the play cursor was significantly ahead of the actual 

playing sound on emulated sound cards; it was directly behind the write cursor. Now, if the 

DSBCAPS_GETCURRENTPOSITION2 flag is specified, the application can get a more accurate play position. If this 

flag is not specified, the old behavior is preserved for compatibility. Note that this flag affects only emulated 

sound cards; if a DirectSound driver is present, the play cursor is accurate for DirectSound in all versions of 

DirectX.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_MUTE3DATMAXDISTANCE</TD><TD>The sound is reduced to silence at the maximum distance. The buffer will stop 

playing when the maximum distance is exceeded, so that processor time is not wasted.</TD></TR>

</TABLE><DT><B>integer dwBufferBytes</B>

<DD>Size of the new buffer, in bytes. This value must be 0 when creating primary buffers. 

For secondary buffers, the minimum and maximum sizes allowed are specified by DSBSIZE_MIN and DSBSIZE_MAX.<P>



<DT><B>WAVEFORMATEX lpwfxFormat</B>

<DD>Structure specifying the waveform format for the buffer. This value must be None 

for primary buffers. The application can use IDirectSoundBuffer::SetFormat to set the format of the primary 

buffer.
