In this case, the nCopies member of the PRINTDLG structure indicates the number of copies the user wants to print, and the PD_COLLATE flag in the Flags member indicates whether the user wants collation. Regardless of whether this flag is set, an application can determine from nCopies and PD_COLLATE how many copies to render and whether to print them collated.  If this flag is set and the printer driver does not support multiple copies, the Copies edit control is disabled. Similarly, if this flag is set and<P>
