In general, do not call this function; the destructor will do it for you. 

<BR>An application should not call DeleteDC if objects have been selected into the device context. Objects must 

first be selected out of the device context before it it is deleted. <BR>An application must not delete a device 

context whose handle was obtained by calling CWnd::GetDC. Instead, it must call CWnd::ReleaseDC to free the 

device context. <BR>The DeleteDC function is generally used to delete device contexts created with CreateDC, 

CreateIC, or CreateCompatibleDC.<P>
